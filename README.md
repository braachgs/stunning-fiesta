CARVE-Markov Engine: Carbon Risk Valuation Engine
üìä Quantifying Financial Risk in Voluntary Carbon Offtake Agreements
The CARVE-Markov Engine (Carbon Risk Valuation Engine) is a proprietary, data-driven framework and simulation tool designed to transform qualitative carbon project risk into a quantifiable financial metric: Value at Risk (VaR).
Traditional carbon risk ratings are static. CARVE utilizes a dynamic, probabilistic Markov Chain Model to forecast the likelihood of project failure (Default or Underperformance) over the multi-year term of an offtake agreement, providing CFOs and portfolio managers with actionable financial intelligence.
üí° The Problem: Bridging the Gap Between Climate Science and Finance
When a long-term carbon offtake agreement fails, the loss is purely financial. The VCM needs tools that speak the language of finance.
The CARVE Engine addresses this need by quantifying the three fundamental tiers of project risk:
Financial Risk: The potential loss (VaR) associated with non-delivery, overpayment, and forward liability.
Execution Risk: The dynamic probability of project operational failure (e.g., issuance delays, methodological weaknesses, developer performance).
External Risk: Systemic country-level and political instability factors (leveraging data like the INFORM Risk Index).
‚ú® How the CARVE Engine Works
The engine operates in two core phases:
Phase 1: Weighted Scoring (CARVE Score)
The framework assesses over a dozen factors, weighting the Project-Level Execution Risk most heavily. These factors generate a single, normalized CARVE Score (0-100), where a higher score indicates a lower systemic risk.
Phase 2: Probabilistic Forecasting (Markov Chain)
The CARVE Score is used to dynamically adjust the transition probabilities within a Markov Chain model. This model simulates the project's state year-over-year across three possible states:
P (Performing)
U (Under-delivering)
D (Default/Collapse)
The final output is a clear Probability of Total Collapse over the contract term and the resulting Cumulative Value at Risk (VaR) for the specified financial commitment.
